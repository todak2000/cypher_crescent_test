Problem Two Calculates the zFactor of a gas using the Hall & Yarborough method

## Install

It was developed in Python. So anyone who want to run it must have Python installed on the local machine. Then install numpy incase and more important is the matplotlib package.

```

$ pip install numpy
$ pip install matplotlib
```

## Usage

```
python problem_one.py
python problem_two.py
```

## Bugs

Kindly note the dimensionless water influx function needed for We/Eo evaluation is still buggy. You could dive in and help. Thanks
